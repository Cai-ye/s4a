拉哈爾。被稱為旁遮普之獅的哈姆雷特國王剛去世並被埋葬不久後，他的弟弟克勞狄斯被冊封為王並娶了其王兄的妻子格特魯德皇后為妻。這導至皇后的唯一兒子－哈姆雷特王子竟成為王位的次選繼承人。哈姆雷特王子為了他最敬愛的父王的死非常傷心，同時也為到他失去王位繼承權和母親與王叔的婚姻恨惡在心。',\n    detail_c2019_2:\n      '哈姆雷特王子的好友赫瑞修和一些拉哈爾堡壘守夜的士兵看見與已死去的國王形式相似的鬼魂，他們為此心絮不寧。赫瑞修決定要讓哈姆雷特知道鬼魂的出現，於是他請哈姆雷特與他同往堡壘守望台。當哈姆雷特看見父親的鬼魂後，驚訝的他獨自跟鬼魂離開，因為他極想知道「它」為甚麼會出現。',\n    detail_c2019_3:\n      '在堡壘的地牢裡，鬼魂告訴哈姆雷特他是被邪惡的克勞狄斯弒君奪位並迎娶他以為會中貞自愛的皇后而死不瞑目。哈姆雷特決意展開他的復仇大計，誓要向他那充滿野心並奪去他繼位勸的叔父報仇。',\n    detail_c2019_4:\n      '哈姆雷特的復仇也不辛傷害了無辜的人。為了他心中的公義，他不斷和自己的理智在對於錯、生與死的問題上交戰。他的愛人奧菲莉亞終日為哈姆雷特的瘋癲行為以淚洗面，而她更因為哈姆雷特拒絕了她的愛而變得失常。哈姆雷特因為忿怒而意外地殺死奧菲莉亞的父親。在多方面的打擊下，可憐的奧菲莉亞跳進水裡了結自己的性命。奧菲莉亞的兄長雷歐提斯從法國回來，得聞父親的死訊後，立即向國王克勞狄斯要求公平處理事件並要知道父親的死的真相，他也深知現在的情況令其妹妹的心靈受到前所未有的創傷。雷歐提斯那忿怒和被復仇燃燒的心正好被國王克勞狄斯利用於殺死哈姆雷特的計劃中。',\n    detail_c2019_5:\n      '雷歐提斯和哈姆雷特即將要進行決鬥。克勞狄斯在酒裡下毒，而雷歐提斯也在自己的劍上擦上毒藥。格特魯德皇后意外地喝了有毒的酒，在她快斷氣的一瞬間，她才驚覺發生了可怕的事，唯有盡最後一口氣大聲宣告酒有毒。哈姆雷特因為母親的喊叫聲分心繼而被雷歐提斯那附毒的劍刺傷。哈姆雷特和雷歐提斯繼續負傷戰鬥，混亂間兩人的劍調換了。雷歐提斯被自己那附毒的劍所傷。他在死前講出克勞狄斯想要殺死哈姆雷特的計劃並請求哈姆雷特原諒他。盛怒之下，哈姆雷特用毒劍刺向克勞狄斯把他殺死，他終於完成了為父報仇的願望。在好友赫瑞修的懷中斷氣之前，哈姆雷特請赫瑞修往後要傳頌他的事。',\n

detail_c2018_2:\n      '島上有一群名叫愛麗兒的精靈，但她們被已過世的島主，莎穹域絲困禁在松樹中。普洛斯彼羅把她們釋放出來，她們抱著感恩的心，成為她最忠誠的僕人，絕對聽從她的指示。愛麗兒深信普洛斯彼羅會遵守承諾，終有一天會換她們的自由。前島主過身後留下兇殘的兒子卡列班，普洛斯彼羅本想好好養育他，豈料他欲侵犯米蘭達，普洛斯彼羅只好把他貶為奴隸。',\n    detail_c2018_3:\n      '多年前，安東尼奧和亞朗素等人揚帆出海，被普洛斯彼羅施以魔法風暴使他們登陸她所在的小島。之後普洛斯彼羅便告訴米蘭達他們間的恩怨。此時愛麗兒把亞朗素的皇兒菲殿闌帶到普洛斯彼羅的山洞，當他第一眼看到米蘭達時，即便沒被施予魔法，也深深為她著迷。為了考驗菲殿闌對米蘭達的誠意，普洛斯彼羅設法勞役菲殿闌；另一邊廂亞朗素以為兒子菲殿闌已經葬身大海，而身旁的安東尼奧和亞朗素的皇弟撒巴時仁更打算合謀，在亞朗素熟睡時取其姓名，幸得愛麗兒出手相救，這個狂妄殘忍的奸計才沒有得逞。亞朗素的管家和隨從因喝醉而糊里糊塗地跟卡列班協定一同推翻普洛斯彼羅，並重奪小島。',\n    detail_c2018_4:\n      '普洛斯彼羅在魔法和愛麗兒的幫助下，用魔法使那些試圖推翻她的人亂了神，同時為米蘭達和菲殿闌舉辦訂婚典禮。當她看盡敵人受盡痛苦後，決定捨棄復仇之念，原諒他們，並從此放下魔法。她寬恕的心就如敵人的暮鼓神鐘，當頭棒喝，破除了他們的心魔。普洛斯彼羅亦安排菲殿闌與亞朗素父子重逢，把米蘭達以菲殿闌未婚妻之名介紹給亞朗素認識，也讓卡列班重掌小島，最後更信守承諾，還愛麗兒精靈們自由，自己則重新登上曼谷公爵之位。',\n

His brother Claudius is now crowned King and has married Queen Gertrude, his dead brother’s wife. This ensures her only son, Prince Hamlet, is placed second in line to the throne. Prince Hamlet is heartbroken by the death of his beloved, and more revered, father.

Prince Hamlet becomes entranced by the sight of the ghost, making him forsake his friends, and follow the ghost when it beckons him, to learn why it has appeared',\n    detail_c2019_3:\n      'In the dungeon of the fort the ghost of the dead King reveals that he was poisoned by the evil Claudius, who now wears his crown and holds the hand of his beloved, and what he thought, faithful wife.

Ophelia, in a fragile state of mind becomes melancholic and tragically takes her own life by drowning.Ophelia’s older brother Laertes, returns from France, upon hearing of the death of his father and confronts King Claudius seeking justice and the truth about his father’s death. He understands how the situation has destroyed his sister’s mind and in his grief, and thirst for vengeance, is deceived by King Claudius, who plans to use him to ensure the death of Hamlet.',\n    detail_c2019_5:\n      'A duel is arranged between Laertes and Hamlet. King Claudius poisons a cup of wine and Laertes has poisoned the blade of his sword for when he strikes Hamlet. Innocently, Queen Gertrude drinks from the cup, and in her final moments realizes what has happened and declares the wine is poisoned. Hamlet is distracted by her cries, and is wounded by Laertes’ poisoned sword. Hamlet and Laertes scuffle and blades are switched, leaving Laertes mortally wounded. As Laertes staggers and dies he reveals the plan of King Claudius to kill Hamlet, and ask for Hamlet’s forgiveness. Enraged, Hamlet stabs King Claudius with the poisoned sword thereby keeping the promise he made to his father’s ghost to avenge his death. As Hamlet lays drying in the arms of his loyal friend Horatio, he asks Horatio to tell his tale.',\n    detail_c2019_6:\n      'So ends the tragic story of the Dark Prince Hamlet, the last Maharaja of Lahore.',\n    schools2019_1: 'Tai Kok Tsui Catholic Primary School',\n    schools2019_2: 'Wu Siu Kui Memorial Primary School',\n    schools2019_3: 'Buddhist Chi King Primary School',\n    schools2019_4: 'Islamic Primary School',\n    schools2019_5: 'Fong Shu Chuen Primary School',\n    schools2019_6: 'Salesian Yip Hon Millennium Primary School',\n    schools2019_7: 'Canossa Primary School',\n    schools2019_8: 'HK and Macau Lutheran Church Primary School',\n    schools2019_9: 'Ma On Shan Methodist Primary School',\n    schools2019_10: 'SKH Yau Tong Kei Hin Primary School',\n    schools2019_11: 'SKH St Andrew’s Primary School',\n    schools2019_12: 'Chai Wan Kok Catholic Primary School',\n    schools2019_13: 'Ping Shek Estate Catholic Primary School',\n    schools2019_14: 'St. Paul’s Convent School (Primary Section)',\n    schools2019_15: 'Tai Po Methodist School ',\n    schools2019_16: 'Delia (Man Kiu) English Primary School',\n    schools2019_17: 'St. Joseph’s Primary School',\n    schools2019_18: 'St. Francis of Assisi’s English Primary School',\n    schools2019_19: 'Precious Blood Primary School South Horizons',\n    schools2019_20: 'Fan Ling Government Primary School',\n    schools2019_21: 'Sacred Heart Canossian School Private Section',\n    schools2019_22: 'Sai Kung Sung Tsun Catholic School',\n    schools2019_23: 'HKCCCU Logos Academy',\n    schools2019_24: 'Holy Angels Canossian School',\n    schools2019_25: 'The Salvation Army Ann Wyllie Memorial School',\n    schools2019_26: 'Pun U Association Wah Yan Primary School',\n    schools2019_27: 'French International School of Hong Kong',\n    schools2019_28: 'Sai Kung Sung Tsun Catholic School',\n    schools2019_29: 'T.W.G.H’s Tang Shiu Kin Primary School',\n    schools2019_30: 'Chan Sui Ki (La Salle) Primary School',\n    schools2019_31: 'Tsuen Wan Trade Association Primary School',\n    schools2019_32: 'Pui Kiu College Primary School',\n    schools2019_33: 'Kiangsu & Chekiang Primary School',\n    schools2019_34: 'Canossa School ',\n    schools2019_35: ' Hennessy Road Government Primary School',\n    schools2019_36:\n      'Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups Lee Shau Kei Primary School',\n    schools2019_37:\n      'St. Margaret’s Co-educational English Secondary and Primary School',\n    schools2019_38: 'Wah Yan College Hong Kong',\n    schools2019_39: 'Renaissance College',\n    schools2019_40: 'Diocesan Girl’s School',\n    schools2019_41: 'CNEC Christian College',\n    schools2019_42: 'Cotton Spinners Association Secondary School',\n    schools2019_43: 'Marymount Secondary School',\n    schools2019_44: 'Ying Wa College',\n    schools2019_45: 'St. Joseph College ',\n    schools2019_46: 'Toi Shan Ass.

Ariel displays complete devotion to Prospero knowing that with Prospero’s promise one day she will be set free.

Alonso believes his son Ferdinand to be drowned. Antonio and Sebastian plan to murder Alonso when he sleeps, but thanks to Ariel this ambitious and cruel deed does not happen.
